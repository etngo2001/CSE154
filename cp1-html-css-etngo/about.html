      <h1>About Eugene</h1>
      <p>
        Hi! I'm Eugene, a 4th year majoring in Electrical Engineering. I'm hoping
        to expand my coding skills and learn more about front end software in CSE 154.
        Outside of school, I enjoy climbing, skiing, and going to concerts! If you
        see me around don't hesitate to say 'Hi'!

      <h3>One of my favorite quotes</h3>
      <!--
        Note: We'll learn about semantic tags more this week, but an article is a good semantic
        choice here to group the information about a single quote and the author/source. If
        you want to have multiple quotes, try duplicating this
        "card UI" structure
