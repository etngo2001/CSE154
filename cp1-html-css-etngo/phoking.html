      <h1>Welcome!</h1>
      <p>
        Now I'm sure you're wondering right about now: 'What exactly is this?' Well,
        allow me to introduce you to Pho King 2022, VSA UW's biennial male pageant!
        Let me explain a little more about Pho King, or PK for short. PK originated
        as a comedic male pageant but has since evolved to become a platform for identifying
        young males to be the changes that they want to see in their communities.
        The goal of PK 2022 specifically was "aMENding HIStory." Now what does that
        mean? To us, it meant redefining what it means to 'be a man.' We wanted to
        tackle toxic masculinity by facing it head-on, addressing it in the public eye,
        in front of our friends, family, and those closest to us. However, the first
        step is always to be the change you want to see. So my brothers and I had to face
        our own flaws rooted in toxic masculinity, acknowledge the actions and behaviors
        that we exhibit, whether in the past or even now, and strive to change. Oh boi,
        I really started blabbering right from the start. I'm sure by now you get the gist of
        it. I introduced it heavily but PK wasn't all super serious. We had a great time
        growing together, unlearning together, and relearning together. This will be my
        documentation of my PK experience. I want to take you through my Pho King experience
        So without further ado, let me introduce you to PK boy #8, Eugene Ngo.

        That's me! Hi! I know you just came from the about.html page but I'm going to
        reintroduce myself anyways. My name is Eugene Ngo. I'm 21 years old and a 4th year
        student at UW Seattle. I am half-Vietnamese half-Chinese and although it took some
        time, I found my community at UW at the Vietnamese Student Association. Last year
        I participated in VSA UW's male pageant. All of the PK boys have different reasons for
        wanting to do PK and I'm here to tell you why I did it, what my journey was like,
        and how I have changed since then! I hope you won't ge too bored and that you
        enjoy the ride!
      </p>

        Now why'd I do it? The short answer: for fun! Last year was my junior year of college.
        I had spent the first quarter of my college experience grinding school and for the
        next year and a half (all of sophomore year) we were stuck inside due to the COVID-19
        pandemic. I was itching to get back and make up for lost time. I heard about Pho King
        through friends of mine but had no intention of doing it at first. My friends pushed
        me to do it and eventually I decided to give it a shot. Since there are only 12 slots
        available, I didn't really think I'd get it. I sent in my application and forgot about
        it until a few months later when I got the email telling me that I'd been chosen as one of
        the 12 contestants. Pretty unbelievable to me at the time. I didn't know it yet, but
        doing PK would lead me to create long lasting friendships and grow more than I could
        imagine.

      <p>Enough about me though, allow me to introduce you to my PK brothers:</p>
